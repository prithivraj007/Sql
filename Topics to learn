SQL is a broad and fascinating domain, covering essential skills and advanced techniques. Here are some key topics you can consider exploring:

### **Basics**
- Understanding databases, tables, and schemas
- Writing basic SQL queries: `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
- Data types and constraints
- Filtering with `WHERE` and logical operators

### **Intermediate**
- Functions: aggregate (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`) and scalar (`LEN`, `UPPER`, etc.)
- Grouping and aggregating data: `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`
- Sorting data: `ORDER BY`
- Joins: inner, outer, cross, and self-joins
- Subqueries and common table expressions (CTEs)

### **Advanced**
- Advanced joins (e.g., anti-joins, semi-joins)
- Window functions (`OVER` and `PARTITION BY`)
- Indexing and query optimization
- Transactions and locking mechanisms
- Stored procedures, triggers, and functions

### **Specialized Areas**
- Handling and querying JSON and XML data
- Data modeling and normalization
- Advanced analytics with SQL (e.g., ranking, rolling averages)
- Temporal queries (`DATE`, `TIME`, and intervals)
- SQL in cloud platforms (e.g., Azure SQL, Amazon Redshift)

### **Practical Skills**
- Building and maintaining database schemas
- Troubleshooting and debugging SQL queries
- Working with ORMs and integrating SQL with programming languages
- Using SQL in data visualization tools (e.g., Power BI, Tableau)
